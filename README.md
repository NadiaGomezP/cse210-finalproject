# CSE 210 - FINAL PROJECT

## Tetris
In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces, which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. 

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Pygame Python 2.1.2 installed and running on your machine. You can install Pygame Python with the latest version by opening a terminal and running the following command.

-m pip install pygame
